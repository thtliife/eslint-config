# @thtliife/eslint-config

This is my very opinionated linting setup, for my javascript projects.

_On install, this will create / update the following files in your package directory._

- `.eslintrc.js`
- `.prettierrc.js`
- `babel.config.js`

**Warning:** If any of these files exist in your project directory, they will be modified.
If you still want to continue, install by simply running the following in a new project folder.

```bash
# Initialise a new project (Optional)
npm init -y

# Install package and peer dependencies
npx install-peerdeps --dev @thtliife/eslint-config
```

glhf :)
